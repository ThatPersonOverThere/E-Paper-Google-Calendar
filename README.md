# E-Paper-Google-Calendar

This is a E-paper calendar that conencts to Google Calendar using C++. It displays the date, seven adjends, when the display was last updated, and batery voltage. 
The goal was to give the user a battery ran calendar that connected to google. 

This was my college senior project. I hope to leave it here as a inspiration to others and for others to understand how projects on a deadline work. This is not a perfect device. Infact for what it is as a calendar, it sometimes cant even tell you the right date. That has to do with the timer section of the code and the ESP32 itself.
